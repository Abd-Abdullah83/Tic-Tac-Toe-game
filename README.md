This project represents a personal milestone in my programming journey. What started as a simple 5-hour practice session to understand pointers and dynamic arrays gradually evolved into a complete Tic-Tac-Toe game, extending beyond my first semester project, Chess.

Initially, the game was developed as a console-based application, focusing on core logic, memory management, and clean implementation using C++. Later, I integrated SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) to enhance the user experience by adding graphics, sounds, and interactive controls.

The game features four different boards, which can be switched dynamically during gameplay using keys 1, 2, 3, and 4. Additional controls include R to restart the game and X to exit. Proper sound effects are enabled to provide real-time feedback and make the game more engaging.

This project reflects how small learning goals can turn into meaningful outcomes. It demonstrates that experimentation, consistency, and curiosity are often more powerful than following rigid plans. What began as a practice exercise became a functional game—proving that real learning happens when theory is transformed into something interactive and alive.
